# Submission Analisis Data Dengan Python

## Overview
![alt text](image.png)
This is a final project from Dicoding in the "Learn Data Analysis with Python" course, aimed at conducting analysis and creating a dashboard from the bike-sharing dataset. In the notebook file, I have included the methods I used for analysis, starting from Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, to Data Visualization.

## Directory Structure
- /Data: This directory contains the data used in the project, in .csv format.
- /Dashboard: This directory contains main.py which is used to create a dashboard of data analysis results.
- notebook.ipynb: This file is used to analyze data that I created through Google Collab.

## How to Run
You can access this Streamlit dashboard through different methods:

### 1. Using Git
Begin by cloning the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sendy-ty/submissions.git
```

Next, navigate to the `Dashboard` directory:

```bash
cd Dashboard
```

Lastly, execute the following command to launch the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
## 2. Python environment and required libraries
Make sure you have the appropriate Python environment and required libraries. You can install these libraries by running the following command :
pip install streamlit
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Using Streamlit Sharing
Alternatively, you can visit the dashboard directly via Streamlit Sharing at https://submission-datasetbike-sharing.streamlit.app/
